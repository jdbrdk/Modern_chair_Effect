        An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting, or participating in extreme sports.

        Adventuring not only expands your mind by building up your bravery, but is also an opportunity to grow and learn. New environments and cultures are packed full of meaningful life lessons that you might not be exposed to in your everyday life

    </div>
        <p class="text">
            Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track.
            <br> <br>
            Among the health benefits of paragliding, you will also help to build a strong core, which helps with balance, posture, and stability. This aerial sport engages your deep core muscles, which strengthens your body so that it also reduces the risk of injury during exercises and activities
